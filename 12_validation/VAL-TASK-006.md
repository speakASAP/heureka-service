# Validation Report: TASK-006 Plan Stock Order Profit Feedback Loop

Validation id: VAL-TASK-006  
Target: TASK-006  
Date: 2026-06-13  
Validator: Agent E

## Summary

Validated TASK-006 boundary preparation only. Runtime implementation remains blocked because required read-only contracts from warehouse, flipflop, orders, payments, and suppliers are unavailable and unapproved. Public-safe eligibility rules are documented in `../16_operations/INTEGRATIONS.md`; no runtime files, schemas, public XML contracts, prompts, tests, logs, or reports were changed to include private values.

## Upstream goal

Task `../11_tasks/TASK-006-plan-stock-order-profit-feedback-loop.md`, goal impact `../22_goal_impact/GOAL-IMPACT-TASK-006.md`, roadmap `../08_roadmap/ROADMAP.md`.

## Criteria checked

| Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Execution plan reviewed | Blocked | `../21_execution_plans/EP-TASK-006-plan-stock-order-profit-feedback-loop.md` remains draft |
| Required read-only contracts listed | Pass | `../16_operations/INTEGRATIONS.md` TASK-006 contract table |
| Unavailable external contracts marked as blockers | Pass | `BLOCKER-TASK-006-*` entries in `../16_operations/INTEGRATIONS.md` |
| Public-safe eligibility rules defined | Pass | `../16_operations/INTEGRATIONS.md` TASK-006 public-safe eligibility rules |
| Invariants preserved | Pass for planning scope | INV-001 through INV-005 preserved by no runtime/XML/schema changes and explicit sensitive-data exclusions |
| Sensitive data excluded | Pass for planning scope | No internal cost, margin, supplier private values, payment details, customer identifiers, raw order ids, transaction ids, secrets, or production samples added |
| Contract/replay validation complete | Blocked | Requires approved external contracts and synthetic examples before runtime validation |
| Deployment readiness evaluated | Blocked | Runtime implementation is blocked; deployment readiness gate can only confirm documentation state |

## Gate evidence

Executed remotely on 2026-06-13 from `/home/ssf/Documents/Github/heureka-service`:

| Command | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `python3 scripts/strict_doc_audit.py --format markdown --fail-on-issues` | Pass | Status PASS, score 100 of 100, 43 files checked, 0 findings |
| `python3 scripts/pre_coding_gate.py --root .` | Pass | `reports/validation/ips-pre-coding-gate.json` |
| `python3 scripts/deployment_readiness_gate.py --root . --target TASK-006` | Pass | `reports/validation/ips-deployment-readiness-gate.json` |

These gates validate documentation state only. They do not remove the runtime blocker caused by unavailable external read-only contracts.


## 2026-06-15 External Contract Gate Review

Reviewer: Agent TASK-006 external contract reviewer  
Scope: Documentation-only gate review; no runtime, schema, public XML, order/payment/supplier raw data, secret, or deployment files changed.

Current decision: Blocked for runtime implementation. Warehouse, flipflop, orders, payments, and supplier owners have not approved the required read-only contracts or synthetic examples. Existing boundaries remain valid for planning only.

External approval status reviewed on 2026-06-15:

| Owner | Required approval | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Warehouse | Read-only stock snapshot contract with freshness timestamp, snapshot hash, deterministic replay key, and synthetic examples | Missing |
| Flipflop | Read-only submission observation contract with feed snapshot hash, public status code, idempotency key, and synthetic examples | Missing |
| Orders | Aggregate order outcome window without customer identifiers or raw order ids, with snapshot hash/replay evidence and synthetic examples | Missing |
| Payments | Aggregate settlement/risk window without payment details or transaction identifiers, with snapshot hash/replay evidence and synthetic examples | Missing |
| Suppliers | Public-safe supplier availability/reliability signal without supplier private values, with redacted eligibility signal and synthetic examples | Missing |

Reviewed controls: read-only boundaries, forbidden data fields, redaction rules, replay/idempotency requirements, validation commands, and handoff notes are documented in `../16_operations/INTEGRATIONS.md` and `../21_execution_plans/EP-TASK-006-plan-stock-order-profit-feedback-loop.md`. Contract/replay validation remains blocked until owners provide approved synthetic examples and contract versions.

## Issues found

- `BLOCKER-TASK-006-WAREHOUSE-CONTRACT`: Warehouse read-only stock snapshot contract is unavailable.
- `BLOCKER-TASK-006-FLIPFLOP-CONTRACT`: Flipflop read-only submission observation contract is unavailable.
- `BLOCKER-TASK-006-ORDERS-CONTRACT`: Orders aggregate outcome contract is unavailable.
- `BLOCKER-TASK-006-PAYMENTS-CONTRACT`: Payments aggregate settlement/risk contract is unavailable.
- `BLOCKER-TASK-006-SUPPLIER-CONTRACT`: Supplier public-safe signal contract is unavailable.
- `BLOCKER-TASK-006-MARGIN-SAFETY`: Margin/profit feedback cannot expose internal cost, margin, supplier private values, payment details, or customer identifiers; only redacted eligibility outcomes may cross into Heureka.

## Recommendation

Do not start TASK-006 runtime implementation. Next action is external-owner review and approval of the required read-only contracts with synthetic examples, contract versions, snapshot hashes, replay keys, and redaction rules.

## Traceability confirmation

Pass for planning scope. `TASK-006` traces to `../10_features/FEAT-006-stock-order-profit-feedback-loop.md`, `../21_execution_plans/EP-TASK-006-plan-stock-order-profit-feedback-loop.md`, `../22_goal_impact/GOAL-IMPACT-TASK-006.md`, and the shared integration boundary in `../16_operations/INTEGRATIONS.md`.
