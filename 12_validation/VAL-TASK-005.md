# Validation Report: TASK-005 Define AI Feed Optimization Contract

Validation id: VAL-TASK-005  
Target: TASK-005  
Date: 2026-06-13  
Validator: Agent D

## Summary

TASK-005 contract definition is complete as a documentation-only change. The versioned AI feed optimization contract is defined in `../23_documentation_contracts/AI_FEED_OPTIMIZATION_CONTRACT.md` with locked redaction fields, locked review states, synthetic request/response/review examples, replay requirements, and a no-mutation proof. No runtime files, schema files, secret files, Kubernetes manifests, or public XML mutation paths were changed.

Runtime implementation remains blocked until human review approves the execution plan and storage/schema changes are coordinated with Agent A or the schema integration owner.

## Upstream goal

Task `../11_tasks/TASK-005-define-ai-feed-optimization-contract.md`, goal impact `../22_goal_impact/GOAL-IMPACT-TASK-005.md`, feature `../10_features/FEAT-005-ai-assisted-feed-optimization.md`, roadmap `../08_roadmap/ROADMAP.md`, sensitive-data policy `../23_documentation_contracts/SENSITIVE_DATA_POLICY.md`, and contract `../23_documentation_contracts/AI_FEED_OPTIMIZATION_CONTRACT.md`.

## Criteria checked

| Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Execution plan reviewed | Blocked | `../21_execution_plans/EP-TASK-005-define-ai-feed-optimization-contract.md` remains `status: draft`; no runtime coding performed. |
| Invariants preserved | Pass | Contract preserves INV-001 through INV-005 by forbidding direct AI XML mutation and requiring deterministic validation before publication eligibility. |
| Sensitive data excluded | Pass | Contract examples use only synthetic identifiers, `sha256:<synthetic-hash>`, and `https://example.invalid/` URLs. |
| Contract/replay validation complete | Pass | Request/response/review schemas are versioned; redaction fields, idempotency key, input snapshot hash, and review-state transitions are defined. |
| Public XML mutation blocked | Pass | AI response schema requires `mutation_authority: none`, `public_xml_mutation_allowed: false`, `requires_human_review: true`, and AI-settable state only `draft_suggested`. |
| Storage/schema coordination | Blocked | Runtime persistence and schema changes require Agent A or integration-owner coordination. |
| Deployment readiness evaluated | Pass | `python3 scripts/deployment_readiness_gate.py --root . --target TASK-005` passed and wrote `reports/validation/ips-deployment-readiness-gate.json`. |

Observed evidence from `/home/ssf/Documents/Github/heureka-service` on 2026-06-13:

| Command | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `python3 scripts/strict_doc_audit.py --format markdown --fail-on-issues` | Pass | Status `PASS`, score 100 of 100, files checked `43`, findings `0`. |
| `python3 scripts/pre_coding_gate.py --root .` | Pass | Wrote `reports/validation/ips-pre-coding-gate.json`. |
| `python3 scripts/deployment_readiness_gate.py --root . --target TASK-005` | Pass | Wrote `reports/validation/ips-deployment-readiness-gate.json`. |
| Contract marker check | Pass | Request, response, review schemas, mutation denial, XML mutation false flag, human-review requirement, and draft-only AI state were present. |
| Control-byte check | Pass | `AI_FEED_OPTIMIZATION_CONTRACT.md` and `VAL-TASK-005.md` contain `0` control bytes. |

## Contract validation evidence

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Versioned request schema | Pass | `heureka.ai_feed_optimization.request.v1` in contract. |
| Versioned response schema | Pass | `heureka.ai_feed_optimization.response.v1` in contract. |
| Versioned review decision schema | Pass | `heureka.ai_feed_optimization.review_decision.v1` in contract. |
| Locked redaction fields | Pass | `data_classification`, `redaction_profile`, `allowed_public_input_fields`, `forbidden_input_fields`, `input_snapshot_hash`, and mutation flags defined as not mutable by AI. |
| Review states locked | Pass | AI can set only `draft_suggested`; approval, validation, publication, and lineage states are set by non-AI actors. |
| No direct public XML mutation | Pass | Contract contains no AI write endpoint and requires `mutation_authority: none`. |
| Human review required | Pass | `requires_human_review: true` required in request, response, and suggestion fields. |
| Synthetic-only examples | Pass | Examples use `PRODUCT_SYNTHETIC_001`, `REQUEST_SYNTHETIC_001`, `REVIEW_SYNTHETIC_001`, `sha256:synthetic-feed-input-001`, and `https://example.invalid/`. |

## Issues found

- Execution plan approval is still blocked; `EP-TASK-005` remains a draft and is not approval to code runtime behavior.
- Runtime persistence, schema changes, and feed lifecycle integration are blocked until coordinated with Agent A or the schema integration owner.
- Human review is required before any AI-influenced public feed mutation path.

## Recommendation

Keep TASK-005 in contract-defined, runtime-blocked status. The next approved implementation step should create a reviewed coding plan that coordinates schema ownership, adds contract tests, and proves deterministic validation before any feed output can consume AI-influenced suggestions.
