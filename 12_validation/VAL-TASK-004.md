# Validation Report: TASK-004 Design Catalog Feed Readiness Action

Validation id: VAL-TASK-004
Target: TASK-004
Date: 2026-06-15
Validator: Codex worker/integration validator
Status: passed

## Summary

TASK-004 now has a catalog feed readiness contract and a read-only runtime dry-run implementation for single-product and bulk readiness.

No schema migration, feed publication, catalog mutation, price mutation, media mutation, stock mutation, or external write was added. Runtime work proceeded after TASK-003 policy vocabulary stabilized and this thread owned shared feed controller/service edits.

## Upstream goal

Task `../11_tasks/TASK-004-design-catalog-feed-readiness-action.md`, feature `../10_features/FEAT-004-catalog-feed-readiness-action.md`, goal impact `../22_goal_impact/GOAL-IMPACT-TASK-004.md`, execution plan `../21_execution_plans/EP-TASK-004-design-catalog-feed-readiness-action.md`, and roadmap `../08_roadmap/ROADMAP.md`.

## Artifact evidence

| Artifact | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Readiness contract | Added | `../23_documentation_contracts/CATALOG_FEED_READINESS_CONTRACT.md` |
| Single-product readiness example | Added | Ready, missing category, zero stock, and sensitive-field synthetic snapshots |
| Bulk readiness response shape | Added | Versioned response with summary, per-item blockers, and no mutation flags |
| Blocker owner mapping | Added | Catalog, catalog-pricing, catalog-media, warehouse, Heureka, and source-owner mappings |
| Replay/determinism requirements | Added | Snapshot hash, fixed input snapshot, stable ordering, and no AI/random dependency |
| Runtime implementation | Added | `../services/heureka-service/src/heureka/feed/feed-readiness.ts`, `../services/heureka-service/src/heureka/feed/feed.service.ts`, `../services/heureka-service/src/heureka/feed/feed.controller.ts` |
| Runtime self-test | Added | `../services/heureka-service/src/heureka/feed/feed-readiness.self-test.ts` |

## Blocker mapping coverage

| Blocker family | Draft codes | Owner service | Remediation ownership |
|---|---|---|---|
| Product identity/state | `PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND`, `PRODUCT_INACTIVE` | catalog-service | Confirm product exists; activate only when approved for public sale. |
| Required public text | `MISSING_PRODUCT_NAME`, `MISSING_DESCRIPTION` | catalog-service | Add public-safe name/description in catalog. |
| Category | `MISSING_CATEGORY` | catalog-service | Map product to a public Heureka category path. |
| Media | `MISSING_PRIMARY_IMAGE`, `INVALID_IMAGE_URL` | catalog-media-service | Attach/replace public HTTPS image URL. |
| Price | `PRICE_MISSING`, `PRICE_NOT_POSITIVE` | catalog-pricing-service | Publish a current positive VAT-inclusive public price. |
| Stock | `ZERO_STOCK`, `STOCK_UNKNOWN` | warehouse-service | Replenish stock, restore stock lookup, or keep product excluded. |
| Heureka settings/XML | `SETTINGS_INACTIVE`, `XML_RENDER_INVALID` | heureka-service | Activate settings; fix source public fields identified by validation. |
| Sensitive data | `SENSITIVE_FIELD_EXPOSURE` | source owner plus heureka-service policy gate | Remove internal cost, margin, supplier-private, customer, or secret values before feed use. |
| SLA risk | `GENERATION_SLA_RISK` | heureka-service | Reduce batch size, improve latency, or run performance validation before release. |

## Criteria checked

| Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Execution plan reviewed before runtime coding | Pass for documentation lane | Execution plan is still draft, so runtime coding was intentionally skipped. |
| Invariants preserved | Pass | Contract maps blockers to INV-001 through INV-005 and does not alter runtime behavior. |
| Sensitive data excluded | Pass | Examples use synthetic IDs, `example.test` URLs, and no secrets, customers, costs, margins, or supplier-private values. |
| Contract/replay validation documented | Pass | Contract defines version, snapshot hash, deterministic ordering, and replay constraints. |
| Runtime endpoint complete | Pass | Added read-only `GET /feed/readiness/products/:productId` and `POST /feed/readiness/bulk`. |
| Deployment readiness evaluated | Pass | Gate command passed; no runtime deployment was performed. |

Commands executed remotely from `/home/ssf/Documents/Github/heureka-service` on 2026-06-15:

```bash
python3 scripts/strict_doc_audit.py --format markdown --fail-on-issues
```

Result: PASS. Documentation audit score 100 of 100, 43 files checked, 0 files with issues.

```bash
python3 scripts/pre_coding_gate.py --root .
```

Result: PASS. Report written to `reports/validation/ips-pre-coding-gate.json`.

```bash
python3 scripts/deployment_readiness_gate.py --root . --target TASK-004
```

Result: PASS. Report written to `reports/validation/ips-deployment-readiness-gate.json`.

```bash
cd services/heureka-service && npx ts-node src/heureka/feed/feed-readiness.self-test.ts
```

Result: PASS. Synthetic readiness self-test covered ready, warning, blocked, unknown, bulk summary, no-mutation flags, and deterministic replay hash.

```bash
cd services/heureka-service && npm run build
```

Result: PASS. TypeScript build completed for the Heureka service.

## Runtime boundary evidence

Remote inspection found existing uncommitted changes in `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `scripts/__pycache__/`; those were not edited for TASK-004. Runtime edits were limited to the feed readiness files and the feed service/controller.

## Issues found

- Heureka remains a readiness and feed owner only; product, price, media, category, and stock remediation remain with their owner services.
- Readiness output is advisory and not persisted. Persisted readiness snapshots remain a future migration-backed enhancement.

## Recommendation

Accept TASK-004 as implemented for the read-only runtime dry-run slice. Future work can add persisted readiness snapshots or analytics events only with an explicit migration/event contract.

## Traceability confirmation

TASK-004 preserves the IPS chain: Vision -> Goal Impact -> System -> Feature -> Task -> Execution Plan -> Contract -> Code -> Validation.
