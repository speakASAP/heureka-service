## Objective

Plan stock, flipflop submission, order, payment, supplier, and margin feedback so feed inclusion stays fresh and commercially safe.

## Upstream Links

Roadmap `../08_roadmap/ROADMAP.md`, feature `../10_features/FEAT-006-stock-order-profit-feedback-loop.md`, system `../04_systems/SYS-001-feed-generation.md`, and invariants `../17_governance/PROJECT_INVARIANTS.md`.

## Goal Impact

See `../22_goal_impact/GOAL-IMPACT-TASK-006.md`. This task supports marketplace growth while preserving Heureka feed invariants.

## Project Invariant Impact

Applies INV-001 through INV-005 unless the execution plan narrows a specific non-runtime documentation-only step.

## Sensitive-Data Classification

Classification: synthetic. Use synthetic product, feed, status, event, submission, and error examples. Do not include secrets, raw production records, customer identifiers, internal cost, margin, supplier private values, JWTs, or logs.

## Contract/Schema Impact

Expected planning impact. Runtime contract or schema changes require a reviewed execution plan, synthetic tests, validation evidence, and approved read-only contracts from warehouse, flipflop, orders, payments, and suppliers before implementation. Until those contracts exist, TASK-006 is limited to boundary documentation and must not change public XML, runtime APIs, prompts, schemas, events, logs, or reports.

## Replay/Determinism Impact

High. Feed validation, readiness, lifecycle, event emission, and status updates must be deterministic for a fixed input snapshot; non-deterministic AI output must be persisted only as suggestion evidence.

## Scope

Stock drift, submission status, order outcome aggregates, read-only payment/supplier contracts, margin eligibility signals, idempotency plan, unavailable-contract blockers, and public-safe eligibility rules.

## Non-Goals

No local order/payment/supplier ownership, no internal values in public XML, no production writes before contracts are approved.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Execution plan is reviewed before coding.
- [ ] Invariant impacts are explicit.
- [ ] Sensitive-data handling is testable.
- [ ] Contract and replay risks are documented.
- [ ] Validation evidence is captured under `12_validation/` or `reports/validation/` before closure.

## Required Context

`../08_roadmap/ROADMAP.md`, `../16_operations/INTEGRATIONS.md`, `../17_governance/PROJECT_INVARIANTS.md`, `../10_features/FEAT-006-stock-order-profit-feedback-loop.md`, `../21_execution_plans/EP-TASK-006-plan-stock-order-profit-feedback-loop.md`, `services/heureka-service/src/heureka/feed/feed.service.ts`, `services/heureka-service/src/heureka/feed/feed.controller.ts`, `prisma/schema.prisma`.

## Validation Task

Validate documentation traceability first; implementation tasks must add targeted tests and gate evidence matching the execution plan.

## Required Gates

Pre-coding gate, strict documentation audit, task-specific contract/replay validation, targeted tests for implementation, and deployment-readiness gate.

## Execution Plan Requirement

This task must not be converted into a coding prompt until an approved execution plan exists.
