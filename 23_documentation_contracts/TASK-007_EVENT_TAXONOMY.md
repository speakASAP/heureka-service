# TASK-007 Event Taxonomy: Growth Analytics And Demand Loops

```yaml
id: TASK-007-EVENT-TAXONOMY
status: draft
owner: Agent F
created: 2026-06-13
last_updated: 2026-06-13
data_classification: synthetic
source_task: ../11_tasks/TASK-007-plan-growth-analytics-and-demand-loops.md

```

## Purpose

Define the draft redacted event taxonomy for TASK-007 so feed lifecycle, readiness, submission, demand segment, lead candidate, and digest events can be reviewed without exposing secrets, raw production records, customer identifiers, internal cost, margin, or supplier private values.

This document is contract-only. It does not approve runtime event emission, marketing writes, lead writes, schema migrations, external service writes, or production data export.

## Intent Preservation Chain

Vision -> Goal Impact -> System -> Feature -> Task -> Execution Plan -> Coding Prompt -> Code -> Validation is preserved through:

| IPS layer | Artifact |
|---|---|
| Vision | `../01_vision/VISION.md` |
| Goal impact | `../22_goal_impact/GOAL-IMPACT-TASK-007.md` |
| System | `../04_systems/SYS-001-feed-generation.md` |
| Feature | `../10_features/FEAT-007-growth-analytics-and-demand-loops.md` |
| Task | `../11_tasks/TASK-007-plan-growth-analytics-and-demand-loops.md` |
| Execution plan | `../21_execution_plans/EP-TASK-007-plan-growth-analytics-and-demand-loops.md` |
| Coding prompt | [MISSING: reviewed TASK-007 coding prompt is not approved yet] |
| Code | [MISSING: TASK-007 runtime implementation is blocked pending contract validation and data-safety review] |
| Validation | `../12_validation/VAL-TASK-007.md` |

## Vocabulary Readiness

The following names are draft coordination terms only:

| Vocabulary area | Current draft values | Status | Dependency |
|---|---|---|---|
| Feed lifecycle stages | `prepare`, `validate`, `persist`, `expose`, `failed` | Provisional | Agent A / TASK-002 final lifecycle contract |
| Feed lifecycle statuses | `valid`, `invalid`, `stale`, `generating`, `failed`, `missing` | Provisional | Agent A / TASK-002 final status contract |
| Policy result codes | `xml_invalid`, `zero_stock_evidence_invalid`, `sensitive_field_detected`, `generation_sla_exceeded` | Provisional | Agent B / TASK-003 policy vocabulary |
| Readiness blocker codes | `missing_required_field`, `category_unmapped`, `media_missing`, `price_missing_or_invalid`, `stock_unavailable`, `feed_stale` | Provisional | Agent C / TASK-004 readiness vocabulary |
| Submission outcomes | `accepted`, `rejected`, `delayed`, `unknown` | Provisional | Flipflop submission contract review |
| Demand segment names | `feed_ready_growth_candidate`, `readiness_blocker_cluster`, `stale_feed_risk`, `zero_stock_recovery_opportunity`, `submission_rejection_followup` | Draft | Contract validation and data-safety review |

Final event names must not be frozen until TASK-002 lifecycle/status names and TASK-003/TASK-004 blocker vocabularies are published.

## Common Event Envelope

All events use this redacted envelope. Examples must be synthetic or masked.

| Field | Type | Required | Redaction rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `event_name` | string | yes | One of the versioned event names below. |
| `event_version` | string | yes | Semantic event version, initially `1.0.0`. |
| `occurred_at` | ISO-8601 string | yes | Event time; do not use raw log lines as payload. |
| `source_service` | string | yes | Constant `heureka-service`. |
| `source_component` | string | yes | Public-safe component label such as `feed_lifecycle`, `readiness`, or `analytics_digest`. |
| `environment` | string | yes | Public-safe environment label; no hostnames or cluster secrets. |
| `correlation_ref` | string | yes | Synthetic or hashed correlation reference; no request headers or session cookies. |
| `idempotency_key` | string | yes | Deterministic key derived from event name, feed type, snapshot hash, and period where applicable. |
| `snapshot_hash` | string | yes | `sha256:<hash>` over a canonical redacted snapshot. Never include raw XML, raw orders, or raw records. |
| `schema_ref` | string | yes | Contract reference, for example `TASK-007-EVENT-TAXONOMY@1.0.0`. |

## Forbidden Payload Fields

The following content is forbidden in event payloads, examples, logs, tests, reports, prompts, and screenshots:

- real customer, supplier, employee, tenant, account, order, payment, or ticket identifiers;
- real email addresses, phone numbers, addresses, session cookies, authorization headers, tokens, keys, or passwords;
- raw order exports, raw production records, raw XML feed bodies, raw operational logs, or screenshots of production systems;
- internal cost, margin, profit, wholesale, supplier private values, payment details, settlement data, or private operational notes;
- database primary keys or object IDs unless they are hashed with a documented salt policy and approved for the target sink.

Allowed examples use placeholders such as `FEED_RUN_SYNTHETIC_001`, `PRODUCT_REF_SYNTHETIC_001`, `sha256:<synthetic-hash>`, `TENANT_SYNTHETIC_001`, and URLs under `https://example.invalid/`.

## Idempotency And Replay

- Each event idempotency key must be deterministic for a fixed redacted input snapshot.
- Replaying the same snapshot and event version must produce the same event name, event payload, idempotency key, and snapshot hash.
- Analytics segments and digests must declare aggregation windows and derive only from redacted event streams or approved aggregate contracts.
- Non-deterministic AI suggestions must not be used as event source truth unless persisted as reviewed suggestion evidence under TASK-005 controls.

## Contract Validation Requirements

Before runtime implementation, TASK-007 must add or update validation that proves:

- event schemas reject forbidden field names and raw payload content;
- examples are synthetic and contain no secrets, raw production records, customer identifiers, internal cost, margin, or supplier private values;
- idempotency keys and snapshot hashes are stable for fixed synthetic input;
- marketing and leads writes remain disabled until contract validation and data-safety review pass;
- lifecycle/status names are reconciled with TASK-002 and blocker vocabulary is reconciled with TASK-003/TASK-004.

## Parallel Execution

| Workstream | Status | Scope | Shared contract |
|---|---|---|---|
| Event taxonomy draft | Ready now | This document and validation report only. | Common event envelope and event catalog. |
| Payload safety | Ready now | Redaction rules, forbidden fields, synthetic examples. | Sensitive-data policy. |
| Lifecycle alignment | Dependency-gated | Replace provisional lifecycle names when Agent A publishes final contract. | TASK-002 lifecycle/status names. |
| Policy/readiness alignment | Dependency-gated | Replace provisional policy/readiness codes when Agents B/C publish final vocabulary. | TASK-003/TASK-004 blocker vocabulary. |
| Demand segment writes | Blocked | Leads/marketing writes and external sink integration. | Contract validation plus data-safety review. |
| Final integration | Final integration | Runtime emission, sink routing, replay tests, deployment readiness. | Integration owner must reconcile all above contracts. |

Integration owner: [MISSING: TASK-007 runtime integration owner not assigned].  
Validation owner: [MISSING: TASK-007 validation owner not assigned].  
Merge order: lifecycle/status contract, policy/readiness vocabulary, payload validation, event emission, analytics digest, external sink writes.

## Blocked Items

- Final event names are blocked on TASK-002 lifecycle/status and TASK-003/TASK-004 blocker vocabulary.
- Marketing and leads writes are blocked until contract validation and data-safety review pass.
- Submission status payloads are blocked until the flipflop submission contract is reviewed.
- Runtime event emission is blocked until a reviewed TASK-007 coding prompt exists and gates pass.
