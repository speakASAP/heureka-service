# Nginx Reverse Proxy Configuration for API Gateway
# Handles connection pooling to backend services to eliminate TCP connection delays
# Uses dynamic DNS resolution to prevent stale IP caching issues

# Docker's internal DNS resolver (127.0.0.11 is Docker's embedded DNS server)
# valid=10s means DNS results are cached for 10 seconds, then re-resolved
# This ensures that when services restart and get new IPs, nginx will pick them up within 10s
resolver 127.0.0.11 valid=10s ipv6=off;

# Note: We use variables in proxy_pass (set $backend) to force DNS resolution on each request
# This prevents stale IP caching when services restart and get new IP addresses
# The resolver directive above ensures DNS is re-resolved every 10 seconds
# Trade-off: Using variables disables connection pooling, but ensures DNS is always fresh
