# TASK-010 Data Owner Handoff

Date: 2026-07-01
Repository: `/home/ssf/Documents/Github/heureka-service`
Status: active owner/data handoff for remaining Heureka feed blockers

## Intent Preservation Chain

Vision -> Goal Impact -> System -> Feature -> Task -> Execution Plan -> Coding Prompt -> Code -> Validation

- Vision: Heureka should reach the same operational parity as the other Alfares sales channels without inventing Heureka-only data paths.
- Goal Impact: make the remaining blockers executable by the correct owner while preserving shared Catalog, Warehouse, Orders, and dashboard contracts.
- System: `heureka-service`, Catalog, Warehouse, Allegro, FlipFlop storefront, and external Heureka onboarding.
- Feature: product readiness, feed inclusion, and external shop/import readiness.
- Task: resolve remaining `ZERO_STOCK`, `MISSING_PRIMARY_IMAGE`, and external onboarding blockers only from authoritative sources.
- Execution Plan: use protected dashboard readiness lanes and the read-only blocker verifier; mutate only after owner approval and required source evidence.
- Coding Prompt: do not infer product stock from order history, do not invent images, and do not bypass Catalog/Warehouse source ownership.
- Code: readiness lanes are implemented in `GET /heureka/dashboard/readiness/lanes`; repository verifier is `npm run verify:heureka-blocked-product-lanes`.
- Validation: rerun the verifier and protected dashboard lane smoke after every approved data change.

## Current Live Readiness

Latest validated live smoke on `task-010-readiness-lanes-dashboard-20260701`:

- Active Catalog products: `40`
- Ready for Heureka: `16`
- Blocked: `24`
- `ZERO_STOCK`: `24`
- `MISSING_PRIMARY_IMAGE`: `11`
- Catalog content lane: `ready`
- Read-only lane API: `GET /heureka/dashboard/readiness/lanes`

## Stock Authority Lane

Status: blocked by owner/data decision.

Read-only evidence:

- Heureka readiness uses Warehouse batch availability and maps `ZERO_STOCK` to `warehouse-service`.
- Warehouse `POST /api/stock/availability/batch` returned `24/24` rows for affected products with `totalQuantity=0`, `totalReserved=0`, `totalAvailable=0`, `positiveRows=0`.
- Allegro current-stock snapshot API returned `27` current snapshot rows and `0` matches for the 24 affected product IDs.
- Allegro local offers matched the 23 `ALLEGRO-OFFER-*` SKUs, but all are `syncSource=ORDER_HISTORY`, `syncStatus=PARTIAL`, `stockQuantity=0`, `rawStockAvailable=null`.
- Order history is not current stock authority.
- Catalog marketplace profile reads for the 24 products returned no stock-like values.
- `PROD9998` / `a2e15cc0-1a94-4faf-a82f-64afea9e9817` has `[MISSING: Allegro offer id/source]`.

Allowed systems:

- Warehouse read reports.
- Allegro current-stock read APIs.
- Catalog marketplace profile reads.
- Owner-approved stock sheet/source.
- Post-approval Warehouse stock mutation only with product ID, warehouse ID, quantity, actor, reason code, and source reference.

Forbidden actions:

- Do not infer stock from Allegro order-history rows.
- Do not write Warehouse without owner-approved quantities and source reference.
- Do not include zero-stock products in Heureka feed unless owner explicitly approves an exclusion/stock policy.

## Media Backfill Lane

Status: blocked by missing approved image assets.

Read-only evidence:

- Catalog product, media, Heureka feed snapshot, and Heureka/Allegro marketplace fields show `media=0`, `IMGURL=null`, and no image-like values for the 11 affected products.
- Allegro rows for all 11 are `ORDER_HISTORY` / `PARTIAL` / `ORDER_HISTORY_ONLY`, with `images=0`, `rawData.images=0`, and `rawData.photos=0`.
- Heureka public feed excludes all 11 affected offer IDs.
- FlipFlop public API returned `403`; in-cluster product API returned the 11 products with `mainImageUrl=null`, `imageUrls=[]`, and `images=[]`.
- Docs/assets search found no matching approved product assets.

Allowed systems:

- Catalog media reads.
- Catalog guarded media upload/create only after approved public HTTPS image URLs/files are supplied.
- Catalog Heureka snapshot readback.
- Heureka readiness verifier.

Forbidden actions:

- Do not invent product images.
- Do not use unrelated screenshots, conversion UI assets, or private/non-public image URLs.
- Do not backfill images for products that owner decides should remain excluded.

Affected product IDs:

| Product ID | SKU / source | Required owner input |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `04df2735-f4a8-4278-8a5e-717c7068e516` | `ALLEGRO-OFFER-17708359010` | approved public image URL/file |

## External Heureka Onboarding Lane

Status: blocked by missing owner/legal/external status evidence.

Read-only evidence:

- Public feed endpoint is reachable and returns XML with `x-heureka-feed-status: valid`.
- Repo has no current external shop approval/import verifier route or script.
- K8s external secret references do not include Heureka merchant/API key approval evidence.
- Prisma schema has `HeurekaAccount.apiKey` and feed settings fields, but no legal/company/IČO/shop-approval model fields.
- Existing docs indicate external Heureka previously accepted the XML check request, while feed-validity/shop status remained blocked/new/pending.

Remaining blockers:

- `[UNKNOWN: shop approval]`
- `[UNKNOWN: current external Heureka import/feed-validity result]`
- `[MISSING: owner-supplied e-shop registration legal/company fields]`
- `[MISSING: Heureka merchant/API key approval evidence]`
- `[MISSING: external Heureka verifier script/API contract]`

## Validation Commands

Run after any approved data change:

```bash
ssh alfares 'cd /home/ssf/Documents/Github/heureka-service && kubectl -n statex-apps exec deploy/heureka-service -- npm run verify:heureka-blocked-product-lanes'
ssh alfares 'cd /home/ssf/Documents/Github/heureka-service && curl -k -I https://heureka.alfares.cz/heureka/feed?type=heureka_cz'
```

For dashboard lane proof, use a real logged-in dashboard session or an in-pod admin JWT smoke:

```bash
ssh alfares 'kubectl -n statex-apps exec deploy/heureka-service -- node -e "<generate short-lived JWT from JWT_SECRET and GET /heureka/dashboard/readiness/lanes>"'
```

Success conditions:

- Products approved for sale no longer have `ZERO_STOCK`.
- Products approved for sale no longer have `MISSING_PRIMARY_IMAGE`.
- Products not intended for Heureka have explicit owner exclusion decisions.
- External Heureka shop/import status is proven by current read-only evidence.
