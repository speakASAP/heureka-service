# TASK-010 Data Owner Handoff

Date: 2026-07-01
Last updated: 2026-07-02
Repository: `/home/ssf/Documents/Github/heureka-service`
Status: active owner/data handoff for remaining Heureka feed blockers

## Intent Preservation Chain

Vision -> Goal Impact -> System -> Feature -> Task -> Execution Plan -> Coding Prompt -> Code -> Validation

- Vision: Heureka should reach the same operational parity as the other Alfares sales channels without inventing Heureka-only data paths.
- Goal Impact: make the remaining blockers executable by the correct owner while preserving shared Catalog, Warehouse, Orders, and dashboard contracts.
- System: `heureka-service`, Catalog, Warehouse, Allegro, FlipFlop storefront, and external Heureka onboarding.
- Feature: product readiness, feed inclusion, and external shop/import readiness.
- Task: resolve remaining `ZERO_STOCK`, `MISSING_PRIMARY_IMAGE`, and external onboarding blockers only from authoritative sources.
- Execution Plan: use protected dashboard readiness lanes and the read-only blocker verifier; mutate only after owner approval and required source evidence.
- Coding Prompt: do not infer product stock from order history, do not invent images, and do not bypass Catalog/Warehouse source ownership.
- Code: readiness lanes are implemented in `GET /heureka/dashboard/readiness/lanes`; repository verifier is `npm run verify:heureka-blocked-product-lanes`.
- Validation: rerun the verifier and protected dashboard lane smoke after every approved data change.

## Current Live Readiness

Latest validated live smoke on `task-010-route-cleanup-20260701`:

- Active Catalog products: `41`
- Ready for Heureka: `16`
- Blocked: `25`
- `ZERO_STOCK`: `25`
- `MISSING_PRIMARY_IMAGE`: `12`
- Catalog content lane: `blocked` for `1` product with missing public Heureka category text and public VAT-inclusive price.
- Read-only lane API: `GET /heureka/dashboard/readiness/lanes`

## Stock Authority Lane

Status: blocked by owner/data decision.

Read-only evidence:

- Heureka readiness uses Warehouse batch availability and maps `ZERO_STOCK` to `warehouse-service`.
- Warehouse availability evidence returned rows for all `41` active products; latest blocker lane reports `25` products with zero available stock and no missing Warehouse rows.
- Warehouse batch rows for the 25 zero-stock products are `25/25`, all `totalQuantity=0`, `totalReserved=0`, `totalAvailable=0`.
- Allegro local offers matched `23/25` products, but all matched rows are non-authoritative order-history data: `ORDER_HISTORY_ONLY`, `syncSource=ORDER_HISTORY`, `syncStatus=PARTIAL`, `stockQuantity=0`, `quantity=0`, `rawStockAvailable=null`.
- Allegro stock snapshot rows for these products/offers: `0`.
- Earlier Heureka-specific Allegro current-stock probing returned `0` current rows because configured OAuth tokens reported `expired_not_refreshed`; no token refresh was performed in that read-only pass.
- Superseding Allegro service evidence from the owner-approved 2026-06-29 complete physical stock recheck found only `9` unique current-stock-authoritative offers in the configured seller surface, with `496` total available units, and Warehouse already matched all `9`. That recheck found no hidden ~500-offer source and does not provide stock authority for the `25` Heureka zero-stock products.
- Order history is not current stock authority.
- Catalog marketplace profile reads for the original affected products returned no stock-like values.
- `PROD9998` / `a2e15cc0-1a94-4faf-a82f-64afea9e9817` has `[MISSING: Allegro offer id/source]`.
- `8edc51f2-bed2-433f-8a3c-5738b49a02e1` resolves in Catalog as SKU `EAN4893575894`, title `Cvetki gorshki`; its current Catalog pricing read returns `data=null`, media read returns `[]`, and Heureka feed snapshot has `CATEGORYTEXT=null`, `IMGURL=null`, and `PRICE_VAT=null`.

Allowed systems:

- Warehouse read reports.
- Allegro current-stock read APIs only when owner-approved and paired with seller identity/readback evidence; the latest approved Allegro recheck found no additional source for these Heureka blockers.
- Catalog marketplace profile reads.
- Owner-approved stock sheet/source.
- Post-approval Warehouse stock mutation only with product ID, warehouse ID, quantity, actor, reason code, and source reference.

Forbidden actions:

- Do not infer stock from Allegro order-history rows.
- Do not treat Allegro token refresh, by itself, as stock authority; seller identity and Warehouse/product readback must be proven before any data change.
- Do not write Warehouse without owner-approved quantities and source reference.
- Do not include zero-stock products in Heureka feed unless owner explicitly approves an exclusion/stock policy.

## Media Backfill Lane

Status: blocked by missing approved image assets.

Read-only evidence:

- Catalog product, media, Heureka feed snapshot, and Heureka/Allegro marketplace fields showed no approved primary image for the original affected products; latest blocker lane reports `12` missing primary images.
- Allegro rows for the original affected products are `ORDER_HISTORY` / `PARTIAL` / `ORDER_HISTORY_ONLY`, with `images=0`, `rawData.images=0`, and `rawData.photos=0`.
- Heureka public feed excludes the affected blocked products.
- FlipFlop public API returned `403`; earlier in-cluster product API returned the original affected products with `mainImageUrl=null`, `imageUrls=[]`, and `images=[]`.
- Docs/assets search found no matching approved product assets.

Allowed systems:

- Catalog media reads.
- Catalog guarded media upload/create only after approved public HTTPS image URLs/files are supplied.
- Catalog Heureka snapshot readback.
- Heureka readiness verifier.

Forbidden actions:

- Do not invent product images.
- Do not use unrelated screenshots, conversion UI assets, or private/non-public image URLs.

## Catalog Content And Pricing Lane

Status: blocked by missing public category and price for one active product.

Read-only evidence:

- `GET /heureka/feed/readiness/products/8edc51f2-bed2-433f-8a3c-5738b49a02e1` returned blockers `MISSING_CATEGORY`, `PRICE_MISSING`, `MISSING_PRIMARY_IMAGE`, and `ZERO_STOCK`.
- Catalog product read returned SKU `EAN4893575894`, title `Cvetki gorshki`, description `Nejlepsi cvetok gorshok v chechii`, brand `ObozBrand`, manufacturer `Pocenice`, `categories=[]`, `media=[]`, and `pricing=[]`.
- Catalog pricing source `GET /api/pricing/product/8edc51f2-bed2-433f-8a3c-5738b49a02e1/current` returned `data=null`.

Allowed systems:

- Catalog marketplace profile/category editors.
- Catalog pricing source of truth.
- Heureka readiness verifier.

Forbidden actions:

## External Heureka Onboarding Lane

Status: blocked by missing owner/legal/external status evidence.

Read-only evidence:

- Public feed endpoint is reachable and returns XML with `x-heureka-feed-status: valid`.
- `npm run verify:heureka-external-readiness` records the public XML feed contract and optional protected readiness-lanes evidence without mutating external Heureka.
- K8s external secret references do not include Heureka merchant/API key approval evidence.
- Prisma schema has `HeurekaAccount.apiKey` and feed settings fields, but no legal/company/IČO/shop-approval model fields.
- Existing docs indicate external Heureka previously accepted the XML check request, while feed-validity/shop status remained blocked/new/pending.

Remaining blockers:

- `[UNKNOWN: shop approval]`
- `[UNKNOWN: current external Heureka import/feed-validity result]`
- `[MISSING: owner-supplied e-shop registration legal/company fields]`
- `[MISSING: Heureka merchant/API key approval evidence]`
- `[MISSING: owner/browser-operated external Heureka approval/import evidence]`

## Validation Commands

Run after any approved data change:

```bash
ssh alfares 'cd /home/ssf/Documents/Github/heureka-service && kubectl -n statex-apps exec deploy/heureka-service -- npm run verify:heureka-blocked-product-lanes'
ssh alfares 'cd /home/ssf/Documents/Github/heureka-service && npm run verify:heureka-external-readiness'
ssh alfares 'cd /home/ssf/Documents/Github/heureka-service && curl -k -I https://heureka.alfares.cz/heureka/feed?type=heureka_cz'
```

For dashboard lane proof, use a real logged-in dashboard session or an in-pod admin JWT smoke:

```bash
ssh alfares 'kubectl -n statex-apps exec deploy/heureka-service -- node -e "<generate short-lived JWT from JWT_SECRET and GET /heureka/dashboard/readiness/lanes>"'
```

Success conditions:

- Products approved for sale no longer have `ZERO_STOCK`.
- Products approved for sale no longer have `MISSING_PRIMARY_IMAGE`.
- Products not intended for Heureka have explicit owner exclusion decisions.
- External Heureka shop/import status is proven by current read-only evidence.
